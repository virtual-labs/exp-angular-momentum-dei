      "a": "A figure skater spinning faster as they pull their arms inward during a spin",
      "b": "A car accelerating on a straight road",

      "d": "Water flowing from a faucet"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "a",
    "difficulty": "beginner",
    "explanation": "When a figure skater pulls their arms inward, their moment of inertia decreases. With no external torque acting, angular momentum must remain constant, so their angular velocity increases, causing faster spinning."

    "answers": {
      "a": "The formation of hurricanes and tornadoes",
      "b": "The motion of satellites orbiting Earth",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "a",
    "difficulty": "beginner",
    "explanation": "As air masses spiral inward toward the center of a hurricane, the radius decreases. To conserve angular momentum, the rotational speed increases, leading to intense spiraling motion."
